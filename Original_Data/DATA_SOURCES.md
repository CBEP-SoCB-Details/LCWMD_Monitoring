Data Derived from ZIP file transmitted from GZA to LCWMD and Curtis Bohlen via on-line transfer.

Original form of the data in excel was poorly organized, and took up a lot of disk space, memory, and computation to access.

1.  It contains a high fraction of replicate data, and
2.  It uses inefficient lookup code to create consolidated data sheets. 

The first thing I did, therefore, was use R to extract data from the excel data into a more compact form. Code and results are in the Derived Data folder.

Portland Jetport weather data downloaded by Curtis Bohlen using a custom python script, titled "noaaweatherdataGUI.py" on April 23, 2020.
