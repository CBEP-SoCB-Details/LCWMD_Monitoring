Data Derived from ZIP file transmitted from GZA to LCWMD and Curtis Bohlen via on-line transfer.

Original form of the data in excel is poorly organized, and took up a lot of disk space, memory, and computation to access.

1.  It contains a high fraction of replicate data, and
2.  It uses inefficient lookup code to create consolidated data sheets. 

This is a substantial amount of data, which contains a fair amount of duplicaiton.
We omitted some portions of the original data transmission from GZA that we did
not use from the GIT archive to save disk space.

Portland Jetport weather data was  downloaded by Curtis Bohlen using a custom
python script, titled "noaaweatherdataGUI.py" on April 23, 2020.
