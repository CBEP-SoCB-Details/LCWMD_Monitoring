# Introduction
This R Notebook explores various models for analyzing chloride levels in Long
Creek. Our principal goal is NOT to predict future values, but to assess the
contribution of certain (time varying) predictors to explaining the pattern in
the time series.

This notebook looks principally at chlorides, which are frequently elevated in
Maine urban streams because of use of salt for deicing of roads, parking areas,
sidewalks, and paths in winter.  While water quality standards are often written
in terms of chlorides, it may be better to think about chlorides as a measure of
the salinity of the water in the stream. Physiologically, it is probably
salinity or osmolarity that principally affects organisms in the stream, not
chlorides *per se*. The data we examine here is based on measurement of
conductivity, which is converted to an estimate of in-stream chlorides based on
a robust regression relationship developed over several years.

We develop a graphic to contrast raw data, simple means, and weather-corrected 
marginal means for understanding chloride in Long Creek.

## Weather-Corrected Marginal Means
We use a (relatively) simple GAM model, developed in the "Chloride Analysis.rmd" 
notebook to provide the weather corrected marginal means.  While we examinied
significantly more complex models, marginal means differed little, and we prefer
model simplicity for the sake of communication to State of Casco Bay audiences.

We use a model of the form:

$$ Chlorides = f(Covariates) + g(Predictors) + Error$$

Where:
*  Site-independent precipitation, weighted recent precipitation, and flow 
   covariates enter into the model via linear functions. Predictors include:
   -- natural Log of total daily precipitation (in mm)
   -- natural log of a weighted sum of the prior nine days precipitation (mm)
   -- natural log of the depth of water (in meters) at Site S05, in 
      mid-watershed.
   
*  The predictors enter the model via linear functions of:  
   --  site,  
   --  year,  
   --  a site by year interaction, and  
   --  time of year (Month in the model we consider year)
   
* The error includes both  *i.i.d* normal error and an AR(1) autocorrelated 
  error.
  
But, because predictions are rather different from observed values (geometric
means versus means, for example), these predictions are somewhat difficult to
present in a graphic form for SoCB readers, so we omit much of the detail from
our graphics.

# Data Preparation
## Initial Folder References
```{r folders}
sibfldnm    <- 'Original_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'figures'), showWarnings = FALSE)
dir.create(file.path(getwd(), 'models'), showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Load Weather Data
```{r load_weather_data}
fn <- "Portland_Jetport_2009-2019.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

weather_data <- read_csv(fpath, 
 col_types = cols(.default = col_skip(),
        date = col_date(),
        PRCP = col_number(), PRCPattr = col_character() #,
        #SNOW = col_number(), SNOWattr = col_character(), 
        #TMIN = col_number(), TMINattr = col_character(), 
        #TAVG = col_number(), TAVGattr = col_character(), 
        #TMAX = col_number(), TMAXattr = col_character(), 
        )) %>%
  rename(sdate = date) %>%
  mutate(pPRCP = dplyr::lag(PRCP))
```

## Update Folder References
```{r folders_update}
sibfldnm    <- 'Derived_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
```

## Load Data on Sites and Impervious Cover
These data were derived from Table 2 from a GZA report to the Long Creek
Watershed Management District, titled "Re: Long Creek Watershed Data Analysis;
Task 2: Preparation of Explanatory and Other Variables."  The Memo is dated
November 13, 2019 File No. 09.0025977.02.

Cumulative Area and IC calculations are our own, based on the GZA data and the
geometry of the stream channel.

```{r imperviousness}
# Read in data and drop the East Branch, where we have no data
fn <- "Site_IC_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

Site_IC_Data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  filter(Site != "--") 

# Now, create a factor that preserves the order of rows (roughly upstream to downstream). 
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = Site_IC_Data$Site))

# Finally, convert percent covers to numeric values
Site_IC_Data <- Site_IC_Data %>%
  mutate(CumPctIC = as.numeric(substr(CumPctIC, 1, nchar(CumPctIC)-1))) %>%
  mutate(PctIC = as.numeric(substr(PctIC, 1, nchar(PctIC)-1)))
Site_IC_Data
```

## Load Main Data
Read in the data from the Derived Data folder.

Note that I filter out data from 2019 because that is only a partial year, which might affect estimation of things like seasonal trends.  We could add it back in, but with care....

*Full_Data.csv* does not include a field for precipitation from the
previous day.  In earlier work, we learned that a weighted sum of recent
precipitation provided better explanatory power.  But we also want to check
a simpler model, so we construct a "PPrecip" data field.  This is based
on a modification of code in the "Make_Daily_Summaries.Rmd" notebook.

```{r}
fn <- "Full_Data.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

full_data <- read_csv(fpath, 
    col_types = cols(DOY = col_integer(), 
        D_Median = col_double(), Precip = col_number(), 
        X1 = col_skip(), Year = col_integer(), 
        FlowIndex = col_double())) %>%

  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels=levels(Site_IC_Data$Site))) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.abb)) %>%
  mutate(IC=as.numeric(Site_IC_Data$CumPctIC[match(Site, Site_IC_Data$Site)])) %>%
  mutate(Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%

# We combine data using "match" because we have data for multiple sites and 
# therefore dates are not unique.  `match()` correctly assigns weather
# data by date.
mutate(PPrecip = weather_data$pPRCP[match(sdate, weather_data$sdate)])

```

### Cleanup
```{r}
rm(Site_IC_Data, weather_data)
rm(fn, fpath, parent, sibling, sibfldnm)
```

## Data Correction

### Anomolous Depth Values
Several depth observations in the record appear highly unlikely. In particular,
several observations show daily median water depths over 15 meters. And
those observations were recorded in May or June, at site S05, with no associated 
record of significant precipitation, and no elevated depths at other sites on 
the stream.

We can trace these observations back to the raw QA/QC'd pressure and sonde data 
submitted to LCWMD by GZA, so they are not an artifact of our data preparation.

A few more observations show daily median depths over 4 meters, which also
looks unlikely in a stream of this size.  All these events also occurred in 
May or June of 2015 at site S05. Some sort of malfunction of the pressure 
transducer appears likely.

We remove these extreme values.  The other daily medians in May and June of 2015
appear reasonable, and we leave them in place, although given possible 
instability of the pressure sensors, it might make sense to remove them all.
```{r}
full_data <- full_data %>%
  mutate(D_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, D_Median),
         lD_Median = if_else(D_Median > 4, NA_real_, lD_Median))
```

### Single S06B Chloride Observation from 2017
The data includes just a single chloride observation from site S06B from
any year other than 2013.  While we do not know if the data point is legitimate
or not, it has very high leverage in several models, and we suspect a 
transcription error of some sort.
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
full_data %>%
  filter(Site == 'S06B') %>%
  select(sdate, Chl_Median) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate, y = Chl_Median)) + geom_point()
```

We remove the Chloride value from the data.
```{r}
full_data <- full_data %>%
  mutate(Chl_Median = if_else(Site == 'S06B' & Year > 2014,
                              NA_real_, Chl_Median))
```

## Add Stream Flow Index
We worked through many models on a site by site basis in which we included data
on water depth, but since the depth coordinate is site-specific, a 10 cm depth
at one site may be exceptional, while at another it is commonplace. We generally
want not a local measure of stream depth, but a watershed-wide metric of high,
medium, or low stream flow.

Middle and Lower Maine Stem sites would be suitable for a general flow indicator
across the watershed. The monitoring sites in that stretch of Long Creek include
include S05 and S17, however only site S05 has been in continuous operation
throughout the period of record, so we use depth data from S05 to construct
our general stream flow indicator.

Stream flow at S05 is correlated with flow at other sites, although not all that
closely correlated to flow in the downstream tributaries.

```{r}
full_data %>%
  select(sdate, Site, lD_Median) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Site, values_from = lD_Median) %>%
  select( -sdate) %>%
  cor(use = 'pairwise', method = 'pearson')

```

We use the log of the daily median flow at S05 as a general watershed-wide
stream flow indicator, which we call `FlowIndex`.  We use the log of the raw
median, to lessen the effect of the highly skewed distribution of stream depths
on the metric.

```{r}
depth_data <- full_data %>%
  filter (Site == 'S05') %>%
  select(sdate, lD_Median)

full_data <- full_data %>%
  mutate(FlowIndex = depth_data$lD_Median[match(sdate, depth_data$sdate)])
  rm(depth_data)
```

Note that because the flow record at S05 has some gaps, any model using this
predictor is likely to have a smaller sample size.

## Create Working Data
Including Site = S06B in the GLS models causes an error, because models that
includes a Site:Year interaction are rank deficient.  We only have one year's
worth of data from that site.  (`lm()` handles that case
gracefully, `gls()` does not.)

```{r}
xtabs(~ Site + Year, data = full_data)
```

We proceed with analyses that omits Site S06B.
```{r}
reduced_data <- full_data %>%
  select (Site, Year, Month, DOY,
          Precip, lPrecip, PPrecip, wlPrecip,
          D_Median, lD_Median,
          Chl_Median, 
          IC, FlowIndex) %>%
  filter (Site != 'S06B' ) %>%
    mutate(Site = droplevels(Site)) %>%
  mutate(Year_f = factor(Year))
```

### Cleanup
```{r}
rm(full_data)
```

# GAMM Model
Our  GAMM fits separate smoothers for each of the three weather-related
covariates. Joint smoothers significantly reduce residual sums of squares, but
add model complexity, without changing predictions of marginal means 
substantially. Arguably, we should also fit separate smoothers by `FlowIndex`
for each site, but this model performs well compared to the more complex
GAMMs.  As we do not interpret the covariates, but use them only to
generate we are less concerned with model details. 

This model takes several minutes to run (more than 5, less than 15)
We check for a saved versioin before recalculating. If you alter underlyinig
data or model, you need to delete the saved version of the model to trigger 
recalculation.
```{r first_gamm, cache = TRUE}
if (! file.exists("models/revised_gamm.rds")) {
  revised_gamm <- gamm(log(Chl_Median) ~ Site + 
                     s(lPrecip) + 
                     s(wlPrecip) +
                     s(FlowIndex) +
                     Month +
                     Year,
                   correlation = corAR1(0.8),
                   na.action = na.omit, 
                   method = 'REML',
                   data = reduced_data)
  saveRDS(revised_gamm, file="models/revised_gamm.rds")
} else {
  revised_gamm <- readRDS("models/revised_gamm.rds")
}

```

### Visualizing Estimated Marginal Means
Reliably calling `emmeans()` for `gamm()` models requires creating a call object 
and associating it with the model as `revised_gamm$gam$call`. (See the `emmeans` 
"models" vignette for more info.

We (re)create the call object, associate it with the model, manually construct a 
reference grid before finally calling `emmeans()` to extract marginal means and
back transform them to the original response scale.

This workflow has the advantage that it requires us to think carefully about the
structure of the reference grid.

We use `cov.reduce = median` to override the 
default behavior of `emmeans()` and `ref_grid()`, which set quantitative 
covariates at their mean values.  Because of the  highly skewed nature of many 
of our predictors, the median provides a more realistic set of "typical" values 
for the covariates, making the estimates marginal means more relevant.

We also explicitly specify that we want the marginal means estimated 
at Year = 2014.  This is mostly to avoid possible confusion.  The default 
creates a reference grid where marginal means are keyed to mean values of all
predictors, here including the year.  The average of all of our "year"
predictors which would be some value close to and probabaly just slightly larger
than 2014. However, we specified `cov.reduce = median`, so we would get the
median Year, which is precisely 2014.  So., although this additional parameter
is probably unnecessary, we chose to be explicit.

```{r}
the_call <-  quote(gamm(log(Chl_Median) ~ Site + 
                          s(lPrecip) + 
                          s(wlPrecip) +
                          s(FlowIndex) +
                          Month +
                          Year +
                          Site : Year,
                        correlation = corAR1(0.8),
                        na.action = na.omit, 
                        method = 'REML',
                        data = reduced_data))
revised_gamm$gam$call <- the_call

```

### By Month
```{r}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(revised_gamm, 
                        at = list(Year = 2014), 
                        cov.reduce = median,
                        cov.keep = 'Month')

by_month <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Month, 
             type = 'response'))

labl <- 'Values Adjusted to Median Flow and\nMedian 10 Day Precipitation\nAll Sites Combined'

# `plot.emmGrid()` defaults to using ggplot, so we can use ggplot
# skills to alter the look and feel of these plots.
plot(by_month) + 
  xlab('Chloride (mg/l)\n(Flow and Precipitation Adjusted)') +
  ylab ('') +
  annotate('text', 400, 6, label = labl, size = 3.5) +
  annotate('text', 220, 9.95, label = 'CCC = 230 mg/l', size = 3) + 
  xlim(0,500) +
  geom_vline(xintercept =  230, lty = 2) +
  #geom_vline(xintercept =  860, lty = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```

Note that all estimated monthly means are somewhat lower than from the GLS
model.

### By Site
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
by_site <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, ~ Site, type = 'response'))

labl <- 'Values Adjusted to Median Flow and\nMedian 10 Day Precipitation\nAll Dates Combined'

plot(by_site) + 
  xlab('Chloride (mg/l)\n(Weather Adjusted)') +
  ylab("Upstream      Main Stem                Lower Tribs        ") +
  annotate('text', 425, 2.5, label = labl, size = 3.5) +
  xlim(0,500) +
  geom_vline(xintercept =  230, lty = 2) +
  annotate('text', 220, 5, label = 'CCC = 230 mg/l', size = 3) + 
  #geom_vline(xintercept =  860, lty = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)

```

### Trends
We extract results on the log scale, so we can calculate the linear 
predictor by hand, then back transform.

Note that our "best" model does not include terms different slopes among the 
different sites.  We have two choices:  fit a single graphical line
that represents the average trends across all sites, or fit parallel lines
for each site.

#### Annual Means.
```{r}
my_means <- reduced_data %>%
  select(Year, Site, Chl_Median) %>%
  group_by(Year, Site) %>%
  summarize(MN= mean(Chl_Median, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD = sd(Chl_Median, na.rm = TRUE),
            N = sum(! is.na(Chl_Median)),
            SE = SD / sqrt(N),
            .groups = 'drop') 
```

#### Single Trendline
To draw a single trend regression line, we have several options.  We could use 
`predict()` to generate model predictions and standard errors, or we can 
calculate an intercept and slope. For SoCB we are not interested in displaying
regression errors.  We simply state that regression results are significant.  
So either approach is appropriate.

We can use `emmeans()` to find an appropriate intercept, and the single
slope is present as a model coefficient.


```{r}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(revised_gamm,
                        cov.reduce = median, 
                        at = c(Year = 2014))
(intcpt <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, 'Year'))$emmean)
(slp <- unname(coef(revised_gamm$gam)['Year']))
```

```{r}
one_slope <- tibble(Year = 2010:2018,
                    pred = exp((Year - 2014) * slp + intcpt))

ggplot(one_slope, aes(x = Year, y = pred)) +
  geom_step(direction = 'mid') +     # puts slope breaks mid year
  ylab('Chloride (mg/l)') +
  xlab('') +
  ylim(0,600) +
  geom_hline(yintercept =  230, lty = 2) +
  annotate('text', 2012.5, 245, label = 'CCC = 230 mg/l', size = 3) + 

  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018)) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```


#### Multiple Trendlines
Here, we follow the same logic, but have separate intercepts, one for
each Site.
```{r}
my_ref_grid <- ref_grid(revised_gamm,
                        cov.reduce = median, cov.keep = c('Year'))

(a <- summary(emmeans(my_ref_grid, 'Site')))
(slp <- unname(coef(revised_gamm$gam)['Year']))
```


```{r}
pred_df <- tibble(Site =  rep(levels(reduced_data$Site), each = 9), 
              Year = rep(2010:2018, 5)) %>%
  mutate(Site = factor(Site, levels = levels(reduced_data$Site))) %>%
  mutate(pred = exp((Year - 2014) * slp + a[['emmean']][match(Site, a$Site)])) %>%
  left_join(my_means, by = c('Site', 'Year')) %>%
  mutate(pred = if_else(Site == 'S17' & Year < 2015, NA_real_, pred))
         
```  


```{r}
ggplot(pred_df, aes(x = Year, y = pred, color = Site)) +
         geom_step(direction = 'mid') +
  ylab('Chloride (mg/l)\n(Weather Adjusted)') +
  xlab('') +
  ylim(0,600) +
  geom_hline(yintercept =  230, lty = 2) +
  annotate('text', 2013, 245, label = 'CCC = 230 mg/l', size = 3) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018)) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```

```


### By Imperviousness


### A Table
```{r}
reduced_data %>%
  select(Site, Chl_Median, IC) %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarize(`Watershed Imperviousness (%)` = round(median(IC),1),
            `Median Chloride (mg/l)` = round(median(Chl_Median, na.rm = TRUE),1),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  #arrange(`Watershed Imperviousness (%)`) %>%
knitr::kable(align = "lcc")
```

### Points Only
We tried repeatedly to alter the y axis limits, but `ggplot2` kept 
placing the `stat_summary()` points incorrectly.  For example, S01 is about
400 mg.l, but after altering the y axis limits with `ylim()`, the points
appear closer to 350 mg/l.  

```{r}
locs <- reduced_data %>%
  select(Site, Chl_Median, IC) %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  summarize(yloc = median(Chl_Median, na.rm = TRUE) - 5,
            xloc = median(IC) + 2,
            .groups = 'drop')

plt <- reduced_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = IC, y = Chl_Median, group = Site)) +
  xlim(c(0,60)) +

#### Add Site Means and Multiple Regression Lines
Solution to separately control width of points and lines in a single legend came
from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61096323/how-can-i-change-the-colour-line-size-and-shape-size-in-the-legend-independently).

The key is writing a function to pass as  the (undocumented?) "key_glyph"
parameter to the relevant geom, here `geom_lines()`.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
narrow_line <- function(data, params, size) {
  # Multiply by some number
  data$size <- data$size / 4
  draw_key_path(data = data, params = params, size = size)
}

plt4.1 <- plt4 +
  geom_point(aes(Year, MN, fill = Site),
             colour="black", pch=23, size = 2,
             data = pred_df)

plt4.1$layers <- c(geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = pred, color = Site), 
                             size = 1.25, 
                             key_glyph = narrow_line, data = pred_df), 
                   plt4.1$layers)
  

plt4.1 +
 # guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 2))) +
  theme(legend.key.width=unit(.4,"inches"))

```
 
#### Add Site Mean Lines and Regression Lines
```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
narrow_line <- function(data, params, size) {
  # Multiply by some number
  data$size <- data$size / 4
  draw_key_path(data = data, params = params, size = size)
}

plt4 +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = pred, 
                             color = Site), 
                             size = 1,
                             data = pred_df,
                             key_glyph = narrow_line) +
  geom_line(aes(Year, MN, group = Site),
             data = my_means, lty = '22') +
  geom_point(aes(Year, MN, fill = Site),
             colour="black", pch=23, size = 2,
             data = my_means) +
